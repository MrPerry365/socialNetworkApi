## Installation
This project uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM, and NoSQL

## Usage
When Insomnia is used, and API GET routes are used for users and thoughts, the data is displayed in a formatted JSON. When API POST, PUT, AND DELETE routes are used, the users and thoughts are created, adjusted, or deleted. The reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user's friend list is successfully created or deleted through the API POST and DELETE in insomnia as well.
